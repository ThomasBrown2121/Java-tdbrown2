## Description

        Marker is the member name, type of Class. Declaring color private and to "black, type String. Next, I made a Getter function that returns the color. Following the getter function. I created a setter function for color.   

        After, I created a main that consisted of Marker named MarkerOne, and I call on the setter function. Lastly, the write function outputs the statement using the String combination of "Writing in " + the getcolor() function. 

        After creating all members of my class Marker, I tested the functions. Making sure that all members were set from the set function. Replicated the same steps for the get function testing if it would able to be retrieved the expected value.
